Just some guy trying to get more serious about coding

Interests I'm developing:  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AI, more specifically how to use and apply it  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competitive programming and algorithmic knowledge  
UPDATE 2/17/2022:
Participated in Google-sponsored AI/ML contest "TensorFlow - Help Protect the Great Barrier Reef". Results:  
  Obtained a bronze medal for placing in the top 10% of 2026 teams.  
  Placed 117th on the private test set, with an F2 score of 0.677 on the final model submission.
