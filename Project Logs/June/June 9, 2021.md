# Overview of today: 
## What I knew beforehand:  
- a little bit of AI ethics
- some technical knowledge
## What I did:  
- continued taking the course "AI for Everyone": stopped at end of video 4 because busy
- continued searching for software to do AI work on
## What I now know:
- ML and DS can be used to improve job functions through methods like automated lead sorting, visual inspection, candidate screening, product recommendation, etc.
- ML automation may run the risk of treating minorities unfairly if the data used includes bias
- VS and Jetbrains will allow me to implement AI in their IDE
## What’s next on the list:
- pick the first AI project
- finish setup for the software environment/IDE
- continue week 2 of "AI For Everyone"(starting on video 5, "How to choose an AI project (Part 1)").
