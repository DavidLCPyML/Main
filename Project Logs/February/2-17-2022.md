Well, that was one hell of a competition! Link here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-great-barrier-reef/overview  
Did a lot better than I expected - Placed 117th out of 2026 with a final selected model submission of 0.677 on the private set (0.675 on the public set). Did little bit better on the public leaderboard, placing 112th with a public set score of 0.689 (scored 0.66 on private set).  
My true highest submission would've hit 0.682, placing me in the top 80 teams (and therefore netting me a silver medal). It didn't do well in the public leaderboard, with a score of 0.653, so I ended up scrapping it in favor of my other public scores. Unfortunately, I didn't think too much about it, as the OOF validation scores seemed to be identical(I was using the same model, after all).  
However, I'm not complaining - bronze on a worldwide competition, AND against people in the actual AI/ML field? I'll take that any day! Besides, picking which model to be your final submission is also kind of a "skill", isn't it? You want the best ones to be generalizable, after all, so that means OOF CV needs to be close to 1!   
In conclusion - Very nice competition, did better than I expected, saw the gap between first place and me, and saw both promising results as well as possible roadmaps for improvement.
