# Overview of today: 
## What I did:  
Decided to use the model provided in https://www.kaggle.com/freshair1996/leon-v5-infer-2-0. Mixed several approaches again.
- Tried tracking - minor improvement to .666, no TT augmentation, just tracking module.
- Saw results improve, so changed up strategy - higher confidence, slightly lower res, and turned on TTA.
      - Ran a bit longer, but got the desired improvement - 0.675! Back in bronze range!
- Not did many other techniques worked. Biggest disappointment was not seeing any LB improvement with SAHI.
- Attempted to use inpainting, just naively pasting COTS in random areas of background images, and training off that set.
      - Didn't seem to show much improvement (.665->.665). I think the model got confused, or all the weights were eventually overwritten to basically resemble the original.
Continued to read up on CLAHE enhancement and HSV. May try to implement these soon.
## What I now know:
I can't prove these until my private test set scores are released. Purely speculation right now.
- I wonder why TTA works that well. It's just like the YOLO augmentations in training, so could it be because the augmentation modifies the dataset to better resemble the train set?
## Whatâ€™s next on the list:
- Try to implement any last-minute inference or Test time augmentation techniques.
- Try that CLAHE enhancement technique.
- Try the HSV(Hue Saturation) augmentation.
