All my data and model attempts submitted to the Tensorflow Help Protect the Great Barrier Reef contest.  
The best baseline model was "f2_sub2.zip" at https://github.com/DavidLCPyML/Main/tree/main/AI%20Adventure%20-%20Projects/Great%20Barrier%20Reef%20COTS%20-%20Trained%20%20models/Ensemble%20weights/3584-2240%20finetune%20transfer/3584-2240%20finetune%20-%20best%20f2  
The public test-time inference scores using this baseline ranged between 0.646 and 0.689, while private scores ranged from 0.594 to 0.682 depending on the test augmentations used.
