# Overview of today:
## What I knew beforehand:  
###### Some technical knowledge on the topic:  
- SVM modeling and regression modeling from my DS classes  
- Heard about Neural Networks and "black box" methods  
- Rudimentary idea about search algorithms such as A* pathfinding function  
- Distinction between AI, ML, and Deep Learning (AI->ML->DL in terms of decreasing scale)  
- USACO Silver/Gold-level algorithmic knowledge  
- Game Theory/min-maxing algorithms in game bots (Deep Blue, AlphaGo, AlphaStar)
###### AI's positives:  
- Massive, far-reaching applications in finance, robotics, computing, and literally every other field.  
- "the Singularity" - some point in time where AI will drastically accelerate human technology/society (thank you Kurzweil, very cool!)  
- Ability to extend lifespans by facilitating advances in genetic engineering and nanotech  
- Could play a role in the use of nanotech to form a kind of 5-sense (AKA "full-dive") AugReality/VirtReality (AR-VR) known as a "foglet"  
###### AI's downsides:  
- "Busy Child" Scenario - Barrat's 2013 novel  
- Massive potential for doom, just not in the ways Hollywood believes it to be  
- "Grey goo" and "infinite paper clips" scenarios  
- "Slaughterbots" and potential for abuse by goverments, militaries, and malicious agents (then again aren't we all)  
###### AI's progress:  
- We ain't nowhere near that anime/scifi stuff online  
- People still overwhelmingly better at performing tasks than an AI  
- "AI" is currently at the "narrow" or specialized stage, AGI projected to arrive in at least 2050-2090  
- AI can do anything in reasonable time a human can do in under 1 second (like identifying a cat)  
- Terrible at being general (i.e. identifying a dog with the cat-identifying algorithm even though people can tell the difference quite easily)  
- quite advanced in Natural Language Processing
## What I did:  
- Explored possible AI projects a beginner could perform, such as __home price predictions__, __Social media analysis/fraud detection with the Enron database__, __Customer Recommendations__, and even a __Chatbot__. 
- Explored platforms I could build AI projects in
