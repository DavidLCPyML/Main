What I knew beforehand:  
    Some technical knowledge on the topic:  
        SVM modeling and regression modeling from my DS classes  
        Heard about Neural Networks and "black box" methods  
        Rudimentary idea about search algorithms such as A* pathfinding function  
        Distinction between AI, ML, and Deep Learning ()  
        USACO Silver/Gold-level algorithmic knowledge  
    AI's positives:  
        Massive, far-reaching applications in finance, robotics, computing, and literally every other field.  
        "the Singularity" - some point in time where AI will drastically accelerate human technology/society (thank you Kurzweil, very cool!)  
        Ability to extend lifespans by facilitating advances in genetic engineering and nanotech  
        Could play a role in the use of nanotech to form a kind of 5-sense AugReality/VirtReality (AR-VR) known as a "foglet"  
    AI's downsides:  
        "Busy Child" Scenario - Barrat's 2013 novel  
        Massive potential for doom, just not in the ways Hollywood believes it to be  
        "Grey goo" and "infinite paper clips" scenarios  
        "Slaughterbots" and potential for abuse by goverments, militaries, and malicious agents (then again aren't we all)  
    AI's progress:  
        We ain't nowhere near that anime/scifi stuff online  
        People still overwhelmingly better at performing tasks than an AI  
        "AI" is currently at the "narrow" or specialized stage, AGI projected to arrive in at least 2050-2090  
        AI can do anything in reasonable time a human can do in under 1 second (like identifying a cat)  
        Terrible at identifying generalities (i.e. identifying a dog with the cat-identifying algorithm even though people can tell the difference quite easily)
