# Overview of today: 
## What I did:  
- Expanded current DLL project to include saving and loading models
- Successfully saved models in both .JSON and YAML formats
## What I now know:
- How to save models in different formats
- How the load_model() and save() functions work
    - For model.save_weights() use model.save_weights('my_model_weights.h5') to save the weights. Then **build your model first**, and then call load_weights on the model.
    - For the save() and load_model(), do model.save(filename), then load it with model.load(filename) -> summary() prints out the summaries.
- saving to JSON or YAML only saves the architecture of the model.
## Whatâ€™s next on the list:
- Learn more about the "Loss" value and possible optimizations
- continue reading up on the sources below
- enact any bugfixes or improvements
- Continue extending the project:
    - Tune the Model: Change the configuration of the model or training process and see if the performance improves, e.g. better than 76% accuracy.
    - Summarize the Model: Summarize the model and create a plot of model layers (https://machinelearningmastery.com/visualize-deep-learning-neural-network-model-keras/).
    - Separate Train and Test Datasets: split loaded dataset into training and testing sets (based on rows) and use one to train the model and the other set to estimate the performance of the model on new data.
    - Plot Learning Curves: The fit() function returns a history object that summarizes the loss and accuracy at the end of each epoch. Create line plots of this data, called learning curves (https://machinelearningmastery.com/display-deep-learning-model-training-history-in-keras/).
    - Learn a New Dataset: use a different tabular dataset, perhaps from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
## Interesting tidbits/ my thoughts:
- DL and ML seem very similar to each other - I'll need more time and knowledge to continue my exploration
